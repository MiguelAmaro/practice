# THE WHY
THIS IS JUST AN SPACE TO WORK THROUGH PROBLEMS THAT I FEEL WILL IMPROVE ON ANY SKILL THAT IM LACKING IN AND/OR TO EXPLORE AT A BASIC LEVEL THINGS THAT I DONT KNOW HOW TO DO.

# RULES
* EXERCISES SHOULD BE BASIC (NOT A PROJECT)
* EVERYTHING DONE HERE IS TIMED
* THE GOAL OF THE EXERCISE SHOULD BE STATED AT THE TOP OF THE SOURCE FILE
* NO CODE WILL BE REUSED FROM A PREVIOUS SESSION. EVERYTHING IS FROM SCRATCH
* ANY INSIGHTFUL CODE & NOTES CAN BE PUT IN THE ./samples FOLDER AND REVIEWED BEFORE A SESSION (NOT DURING)
* LOG THE PROGRESS MADE AND THE DATE OF THE SESSION
* AFTER THE SESSION CODE IN THE SOURCE SHOULD BE DELETED AND ONLY THE GOAL STATEMENT AND LOGS SHOULD REMAIN
